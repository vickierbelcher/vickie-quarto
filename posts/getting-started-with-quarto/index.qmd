This post explains how to setup a website quarto, customizing it and adding new content to it.

## Setting Up: Fork the template repository

The first step is to fork the [quarto-website-template][1] repository.

* Go to the [repository page][1] and click on the _Fork_ button
* Select a name for your repository
* Write a description for your repository
* Make sure you uncheck the checkbox _Copy the main branch only_
* And click on _Create Fork_ button

After this step, you'll have your own repository with a copy of the template.

The website will be automatically published whenever you push any changes to the repository.

The website will be live at URL `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>`.

## Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your computer so that you can make changes to it.

If you wish you can skip this step and make changes directly from github.com web interface.

## Customize site title

Edit the `_quarto.yml` file and update the `title` field in the `website` section.

Commit your changes and push them. The website will be live with the new changes in a minute or two.

## Create new pages

Add a new file `hello.qmd` (or whatever name that you would like to use). Add the require content.

```{.md filename="hello.qmd"}
# Hello

Hello, world!
```

If you wish to include that page in the top navigation, add that to navbar.

```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Sample Quarto Website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - hello.qmd
      - about.qmd
```

Commit & push you changes and wait for a minute to see your changes.

## Adding blog posts

The blog posts are in `/posts/` directory. There is one directory for every post and the content of the post is in a file `index.qmd` in the post directory. A directory is used for a post instead of a single qmd file so that all the supplimentary files like images etc. could be grouped along with the post.

The easiest way to add a new post is to duplicate one of the posts (the while directory for a post), rename it to the name that you want and modify the content.

## Share your website!

Your website is live now! Share it with your friends!
